export const ABOUT_ME = {
  content: `I'm a passionate and dedicated Full-Stack Developer pursuing a Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Computer Science. With a strong foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, I specialize in crafting modern, responsive web applications using tools like React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB.
  
  I have hands-on experience in building scalable full-stack projects, integrating REST APIs, and working with databases. My interests span across software architecture, backend optimization, and creating seamless user experiences. Iâ€™m also skilled in Java, JavaScript, Express.js, Git, and Postman, and I consistently practice Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) to improve problem-solving skills.
  
  Beyond development, I'm a quick learner and a strong believer in continuous improvement. I enjoy leading group projects and contributing to collaborative environments, showcasing leadership and teamwork qualities. Whether it's debugging code at midnight or helping peers in group assignments, I thrive in tech-driven environments that challenge me to grow.
  
  My journey in Computer Science is driven by curiosity, creativity, and a commitment to build solutions that make a meaningful impact.`,
